# Private RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Ollama

This project is a modified version of the example found in the Ollama repository, specifically from [ollama/examples/langchain-python-rag-privategpt](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main/examples/langchain-python-rag-privategpt).

## Description

This project implements a private Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Ollama, LangChain, and various document loaders. It allows you to ingest documents from different file formats, create embeddings, and then query your documents using a local language model, all without requiring an internet connection.
